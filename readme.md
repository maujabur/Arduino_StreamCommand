StreamCommand
=============
A Wiring/Arduino library to tokenize and parse commands received over a stream (serial port or others) 

The original version of this library was written by [Steven Cogswell](http://husks.wordpress.com) (published May 23, 2011 in his blog post ["A Minimal Arduino Library for Processing Serial Commands"](http://husks.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/a-minimal-arduino-library-for-processing-serial-commands/)).

After a heavily modified version with smaller footprint and a cleaned up code by Stefan Rado [here](https://github.com/kroimon/Arduino-SerialCommand).

Now it's possible to specify the interface using a Stream object (hardware or software serial or other implementations)
